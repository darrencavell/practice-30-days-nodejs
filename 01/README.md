## Welcome to Day 1 Node.JS - 22nd September 2019 ##

Use the following command `node [specified things below]`

There are 5 things:
1. `hello-world.js`
2. `simple-server.js`
3. `serve-string.js`
4. `serve-html.js`
5. `serve-json.js`
6. `serve-pdf.js`
7. `serve-mp3.js`
8. `serve-video.js`

Most of them does not have the `console.log` statement, but the server is running!
